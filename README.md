belinda / ClusPolars
=============

Data science library add-on for `polars` specialized for **clustering analysis** for large-scale graphs, with some graph analytics sprinkled in.

This library is a heavy work in progress, and the API *will* change substantially (to generalize
beyond graph clusterings). Currently,
it is being used in-house, and user feedback will be heavily used to influence future API decisions.
